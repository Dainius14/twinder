# Twinder
A sophisticated (not so much actually) Tinder client made using Windows Presentation Foundations technology and unofficial Tinder API.

*Disclaimer: As this is using unofficial API, I am not to be held responsible for any account loses, bans and other things that may happen due to the usage of this software.*

#### What is the purpose of this application if there's already a pretty nice mobile app available?
First and foremost, this is a *desktop* application, so you don't need to reach your phone to Tinder, which is the main advantage of this program.
Most of the other advantages are derivatives of the main advantage e.g. you can chat with multiple people at one time and view photos more comfortably.

#### Is everything working?
Yes, except for that group thing and you can't upload your photos yet.
