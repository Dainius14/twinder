# Twinder
A sophisticated (not so much actually) Tinder client made using Windows Presentation Foundations technology and unofficial Tinder API.

*Disclaimer: As this is using an unofficial API, I am not to be held responsible for any account loses, bans and other things that may happen or not happen due to the usage of this software.*

#### What is the purpose of this application if there's already a pretty nice mobile app available?
First and foremost, this is a *desktop* application, so you don't need to reach your phone to Tinder, which is the main advantage of this program.
Second, every match is saved on your computer, so you will never lose the girl that unmatched you!
You can filter your match list to find the match you desire - no more boring scrolling just to find the girl you need.
Most of the other advantages are derivatives of the main advantage e.g. you can chat with multiple people at one time and view photos more comfortably.

#### Is everything working?
Yes, except for that group thing and you can't upload your photos yet and you can't see Instagram pictures (well in data folder pics are all there) and you can't use any Spotify features and chat doesn't show GIFs and no colorful emoji support.
