# Twinder
A sophisticated (not so much actually) Tinder client made using Windows Presentation Foundations technology and unofficial Tinder API.

*Disclaimer: As this is using an unofficial API, I am not to be held responsible for any account loses, bans and other things that may happen or not happen due to the usage of this software.*

***

Note: I'm stopping development for this program. Feel free to fork and edit this horrible codebase.

[Download here](https://github.com/Dainius14/twinder/releases)

Building requires [Bing Maps SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=27165) to be installed.

### Features:
* Main Tinder functionalities without the bells and whistles
* See people who unmatched you, people you unmatched, passed and pending recommendations
* Multi-user support
* Location spoofing
* Match filtering
* All match and recommendation data is stored in your %appdata% folder
* Beautiful chat with Emoji support


### Many more things are yet to come as this is an early release

#### What is the purpose of this application if there's already a pretty nice mobile app available?
First and foremost, this is a *desktop* application, so you don't need to reach your phone to Tinder, which is the main advantage of this program.
Second, every match is saved on your computer, so you will never lose the girl that unmatched you!
You can filter your match list to find the match you desire - no more boring scrolling just to find the girl you need.
Most of the other advantages are derivatives of the main advantage e.g. you can chat with multiple people at one time and view photos more comfortably.

#### Is everything working?
Yes, except for that group thing and you can't upload your photos yet and you can't use any Spotify features and chat doesn't show GIFs.
